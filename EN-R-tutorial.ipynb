    "## Using Tidyverse\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example of analysis of CMS Open Data uses the so-called \"base R\" software without calling any external packages.\n",
    "However, the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package (which is really a collection of a family of related packages) greatly simplifies both the manipulation/analysis of data and its visualisation.\n",
    "It is fast becoming a standard in the world of data science, and there are good reasons to [teach tidyverse to beginners](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/) (see issue [\\#3](https://github.com/cms-opendata-education/cms-rmaterial-multiple-languages/issues/3)).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we thought we could demonstrate the above analysis of CMS Open Data using the `tidyverse` package not only to show you how you can simplify and steamline your code but also to make your explorations with CMS Open Data using R a little more enjoyable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can condense the whole process of importating the data, manipulating the variables in the dataset and visualising the contents in the form of a plot using a single, relatively small code chunk (see explanation below):"
